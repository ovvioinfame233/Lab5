Part 1:


1) background-color: purple

In the CSS file you would write it as the name of the ID. 

#div1 {
	background-color: purple;
}

2) margin-left: 100px, padding-top: 100px

Changing the margin changes where the divs should start Ex. Indent(Where you want the page to start.

The padding is the distance between the text and the borders that it is confined in.

3) If the margin get bigger than 100px, then the 1 would move outside the box and closer to the second. When the padding is changed to 100px and greater, then the 1 would move closer to the center of the page.

4) The scroll would show the overflow with scrolling in the vertical and horixonatal direction, while the  hidden does not show it.

5) They go 1,2,3 from Left to right. If it was right it would go the opposite way 3,2,1.

6) They are all on the right side of the page, in the order 1,2,3 going top to bottm

7) Div1 has float : left, Div2 has float : left, Div3 has clear : left

8) I would move the boxes all the way to the left with no space in between the margin and the edge of the webpage
